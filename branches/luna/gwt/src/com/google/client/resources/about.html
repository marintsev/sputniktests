<h2>What is Sputnik?</h2> 
Sputnik is a JavaScript 3 conformance test suite.  The purpose
of the test suite is to determine how well a JavaScript
implementation adheres to
the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMA-262</a> 
specification, 3rd edition. It contains over 5000 tests that
touch all aspects of the JavaScript language.

<h2>What is this site?</h2> 

This site allows you to run the sputnik tests and to compare the
most popular browsers' test results.

<h3>Run</h3> 

On the <a href="run">run</a> page you can run the full test
suite in your browser and browse the failing tests.  Note that
running the tests is a fairly strenuous exercise for a browser
and will cause some browsers, particularly older ones, to
crash or stall.  If this happens you can close and reopen your
browser and continue running where you left off.

<h3>Compare</h3> 

The <a href="compare">compare</a> page shows an experimental plot
illustrating how popular browsers perform compared to each
other. The distance to the center shows how close the browser is to
passing all tests; the further the browser is from the center the
more tests it fails.  The distance between browsers shows how
different they are; the more similar two browsers are &ndash; the
more test failures they have in common &ndash; the closer they will
be.

<h2>Version 1?</h2> 

This is version 1 of the Sputnik tests.  We
will be making revisions from time to time as we add more tests or
fix bugs.  Note that test results are not compatible unless both
results are run with the same revision of the test suite.
