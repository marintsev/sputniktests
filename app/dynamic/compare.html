        This experimental plot illustrates how the latest stable
        versions of the most popular browsers perform compared to each
        other when running Sputnik on Windows XP.
      </p><p>

        The distance to the center shows how close the browser is to
        passing all tests; the further the browser is from the center
        the more tests it fails.  The distance between browsers shows
        how different they are; the more similar two browsers are
        &ndash; the more test failures they have in common &ndash; the
        closer they will be.  Hover over each browser icon to see the
        number of failures and the number of differences between that
        and the other browsers.
