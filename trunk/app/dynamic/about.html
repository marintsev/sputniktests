  <h2>What is Sputnik?</h2>
  Sputnik is a JavaScript 3 conformance test suite.  The purpose
  of the test suite is to determine how well a JavaScript
  implementation adheres to
  the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMA-262</a>
  specification, 3rd edition. It contains over 5000 tests that
  touch all aspects of the JavaScript language.

  <h2>What is this site?</h2>
  
  This site allows you to run the sputnik tests, browse the
  individual tests in the test suite, and to compare the most
  popular browsers' test results.
  
  <h3>Run</h3>
  
  On the <a href="run">run</a> page you can run the full test
  suite in your browser and browse the failing tests.  Note that
  running the tests is a fairly strenuous exercise for a browser
  and will cause some browsers, particularly older ones, to
  crash or stall.  If this happens you can close and reopen your
  browser and continue running where you left off.
  
  <h3>Browse</h3>
  
  The <a href="browse">browse</a> page allows you to browse all
  the tests.  Currently you can just see the name, description
  and source code for each test.
  
  <h3>Compare</h3>
  
  The <a href="compare">compare</a> page shows an experimental plot
  illustrating how popular browsers perform compared to each
  other. The distance to the center shows how close the browser is to
  passing all tests; the further the browser is from the center the
  more tests it fails.  The distance between browsers shows how
  different they are; the more similar two browsers are &ndash; the
  more test failures they have in common &ndash; the closer they will
  be.
