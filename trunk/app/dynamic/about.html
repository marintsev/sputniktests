  <h2>What is Sputnik?</h2>

  Sputnik is a JavaScript conformance test suite containing over 5000
  tests.  It tests how well a JavaScript implementation adheres to
  the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMA-262
  </a> specification version 5, looking only at those features
  that were also present in the previous version, version 3, and not the new
  features added in version 5.

  <h2>What is this site?</h2>
  
  This site allows you to run the sputnik tests and to compare the
  most popular browsers' test results.
  
  <h3>Run</h3>
  
  On the <a href="run">run</a> page you can run the full test
  suite in your browser and browse the failing tests.  Note that
  running the tests is a fairly strenuous exercise for a browser
  and will cause some browsers, particularly older ones, to
  crash or stall.  If this happens you can close and reopen your
  browser and continue running where you left off.
  
  <h3>Compare</h3>
  
  The <a href="compare">compare</a> page shows an experimental plot
  illustrating how popular browsers perform compared to each
  other. The distance to the center shows how close the browser is to
  passing all tests; the further the browser is from the center the
  more tests it fails.  The distance between browsers shows how
  different they are; the more similar two browsers are &ndash; the
  more test failures they have in common &ndash; the closer they will
  be.

  <h2>Version {{test_suite_version}}?</h2>

  This is version {{test_suite_version}} of the Sputnik tests.  We
  will be making revisions from time to time as we add more tests or
  fix bugs.  Note that test results are not compatible unless both
  results are run with the same revision of the test suite.

  <p>

  Version 2 fixes a bug that caused later versions of Internet
  Explorer to emulate version 7.
