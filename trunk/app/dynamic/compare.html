        This experimental plot illustrates how popular browsers
        perform compared to each other.
      </p><p>
        The distance to the center shows how close the browser is to
        passing all tests; the further the browser is from the center
        the more tests it fails.  The distance between browsers shows
        how different they are; the more similar two browsers are &ndash;
        the more test failures they have in common &ndash; the closer they
        will be.
